# Highschool-Processing-Games
**Starfighter** and **Brick Breaker** games coded with Java in Processing 3.0.

I made these games sometime in 2014/2015 and recently recovered them from the hard drive of the old family computer. I'm leaving the source code as it is (fairly messy) for now but I might come back to improve Starfighter sometime since blowing up alien ships with an obscene amount of bullets never grows old. 

## Requirements
- Brick Breaker
    - Source code compiles and runs in [Processing](https://processing.org/download/)

- Starfighter
    - Source code compiles and runs in [Processing](https://processing.org/download/)
    - Requires the [Minim](https://github.com/ddf/Minim) library

## Game Mechanics
- Brick Breaker
    - The paddle follows your **mouse** horizontally

- Starfighter
    - Use **arrow keys** to move your ship
    - Use **space** to shoot
